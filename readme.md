# Framework Laptop Input Cover Adapter

This is an Adapter-PCB for the [Keyboard-Input connector](https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Framework-Laptop-13/blob/main/Electrical/Pinouts.md#input-cover-interface) on the 13" Framework Laptop.

It aims to create a more convenient way to Power up the Board compared to the small button on the PCB itself. It also has pins for a USB 2.0 connection, because why not?

As of right now I'm still waiting for the PCBs to arrive, so I can't confirm it to work 100% but is far as I can tell it should be fine.

I'll update the readme as soon they arrive.
